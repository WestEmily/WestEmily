<h1>Hello, I'm Emily West!</h1>

<h2>🚀 About Me </h2>
<b> I am a graduate student at Oregon State University pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. I graduated from Western Oregon University with a bachelor’s degree in computer science in Spring of 2023. While at WOU, I was also a 4-year DII volleyball player for the wolves. My programming background is mainly in C# and Python from WOU, while I am developing my C++ skills at Oregon State. I am highly interested in creating diverse and inclusive programs, especially when it comes to Artificial Intelligence.  </b>
